    <p class="lead"><b> The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan in New
        York City, United States. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is
        derived from "Empire State", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet
        (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. <br> The Empire State Building
        stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the World Trade Center in 1970; following the
        latter's collapse in 2001, the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest skyscraper until 2012. As of
        2020, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in
        the United States, the 49th-tallest in the world, and the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas.
        <br>
        The site of the Empire State Building, in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and
        34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site
        and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times
        until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the
        building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the
        building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit
        until the early 1950s. <br>
        The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around
        four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories;
        an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an American
        cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film King Kong was released
        in 1933. The building's size has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of
        other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the
        Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of
        Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its
        ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in
        1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.
