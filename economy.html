        of New York City.
        Economy of New York
        Flag-map of New York.svg
        Statistics
        GDP $1.751 trillion (2019)
        GDP per capita $90,043 (2019)
        Population below poverty line 13.6%
        Gini coefficient 0.502
        Labour force 9,633,503 (2018)
        Unemployment 3.7% (Feb. 2020)
        Public finances
        Revenues $63.5 billion
        Expenses $54.6 billion
        The economy of the State of New York is reflected in its gross state product in 2018 of $US1.7 trillion, ranking
        third in size behind the larger states of California and Texas. If New York State were an independent nation, it
        would rank as the 10th largest economy in the world. However, in 2019, the multi-state, New York City-centered
        metropolitan statistical area produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $US2.0 trillion, ranking first
        nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only nine nations.

        New York City and the surrounding New York metropolitan area dominate the economy of the state. Manhattan is the
        leading center of banking, finance, and communication in the United States and is the location of the New York
        Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wall Street. Many of the world's largest corporations locate their home offices in
        Manhattan or in nearby Westchester County. Manhattan contained over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of
        office space in 2015, making it the largest office market in the United States, while Midtown Manhattan, with
        nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2015, is the largest central business district in the world.
        The state also has a large manufacturing sector, which includes printing and publishing and the production of
        garments, furs, railroad rolling stock, and bus line vehicles. Some industries are concentrated in upstate
        locations also, such as ceramics and glass (the southern tier of counties), microchips and nanotechnology
        (Albany), and photographic equipment (Rochester). New York's agricultural outputs comprise dairy products,
        cattle and other livestock, vegetables, nursery stock, and apples. In April 2021, GlobalFoundries, a company
        specializing in the semiconductor industry, moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley, California to its most
        advanced semiconductor-chip manufacturing facility in Saratoga County near a section of the Adirondack Northway,
        in Malta, New York.
